# Q) What is the difference between for loop and while loop
#   in Python?
# Any ---- We can use loops to repeat code execution
#     ---- Repeat code for every item in sequence  for loop
#     ---- Repeat code as long as condition is true  while loop

# Q) How to exit from the loop? By using break statement
# Q)How to skip some iterations inside loop? By using continue statement.
# Q)When else part will be executed wrt loops? If loop executed without break


# 3)pass statement:
#               ---------->pass is a keyword in Python.
#               ---------->In our programming syntactically if block is required which won't do anything then we  
#                         can define that empty block with pass keyword.

# pass
#  |- It is an empty statement
#  |- It is null statement
#  |- It won't do anything

# Eg: if True:
#  SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
#  if True: pass  valid
