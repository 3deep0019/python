# What is String?
# -----------------> Any sequence of characters within either single quotes or double quotes is considered as a 
#                    String.

#  **** The most commonly used object in any project and in any programming language is String 
#       only. Hence we should aware complete information about String data type.


# Syntax:
# s = 'durga'
# s = "durga"

# Note:   In most of other languges like C, C++, Java, a single character with in single quotes 
#         is treated as char data type value. But in Python we are not having char data type.Hence it 
#         is treated as String only.

# Eg:
# >>> ch = 'a'
# >>> type(ch)
# <class 'str'>

# How to define multi-line String Literals?
# We can define multi-line String literals by using triple single or double quotes.

# Eg:
# >>> s = '''durga
# software
# solutions'''

# ***** We can also use triple quotes to use single quotes or double quotes as symbol inside 
#       String literal.

#   Example
# 
#            s = 'The \"Python Notes\" by \'durga\' is very helpful'  Valid
#            s = '''The "Python Notes" by 'durga' is very helpful'''  Valid
