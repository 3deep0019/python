# Assignment operators
# -----------> We can use assignment operator to assign value to the variable.
#     Eg:
#       x = 10

#        ******    We can combine asignment operator with some other operator to form compound 
#                  assignment operator.
#             Eg: 
#                  x += 10 ïƒ  x = x+10

#     -----> The following is the list of all possible compound assignment operators in Python.
#         +=
#         -=
#         *=
#         %=
#        //=
#        **=
#        &=
#        |=
#        ^=
#       >>=
#      <<=
# 
 a = 10 
 b = a+20
 print(b)
