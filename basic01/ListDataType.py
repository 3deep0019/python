# if we want to represent a group of values as a single entity where insertion order required
#   to preserve and duplicates are allowed are allowwed then we should go for list data type .

list=[10,20,30,40]
print(list[0])
print(list[-1])
print(list[1:3])
list[0]=100
for i in list:print(i)


#  --- **** list is growable in nature . Besed on our requirement we can increase or decrease the size.
