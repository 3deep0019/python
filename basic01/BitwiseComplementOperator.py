# Bitwise Complement Operator (~):
#       -------------> We have to apply complement for total bits.

# print(~5)  ------->-6



# Note:
# ------> The most significant bit acts as sign bit. 0 value represents +ve number where as 1 
#         represents -ve value.


# -------> Positive numbers will be repesented directly in the memory where as -ve numbers will 
#          be represented indirectly in 2's complement form.
